# List of diagnoses

1. Neutropenia (NPU02902) Neutrofilocytter <0.5x10 ^ 9 / L for over 10 days.
Slider for concentration and days (two sliders)
2. Severe infection (NPU19748) (CRP> 100 mg / L or elevated CRP for> 7 days).
Slider for concentration and days (two sliders)
3. Neutropenia with infection - that is Neutropenia coupled with Severe infection.
Just the check boxes - so if you have Neutropenia and Severe infection we don’t need this 
4. Severe hepatic effects elevated liver enzyme (NPU19651) ALAT >45 U/I and affected (NPU01684) P-Koagulationsfaktorer 2,7,10 (PP) <0.40 OR elevated (NPU01370) bilirubin> 40 µM.
Slider at concentrations (three sliders)
5. Post-treatment toxicity in high-risk ALL. By calculating the time between individual blocks by looking at the blood samples leukocytes and neutrophils. They start always treatment when the level of leukocytes is about 1.5x10 ^ 9 / L. (course schedules) I will get back to you with this one tomorrow. 
6. Renal toxicity if creatinine (NPU18016) is > 150 µmol/l.
Slider at concentration
7. use plasma albumin and creatinine to assess their overall effect along with weight recorded during the MTX infusions.
8. Thrombocytopenia (NPU03568) b-Trombocytter <10x10 ^ 9 / L) for more then 72h duration. (If high multiple blood samples might be taken).
Slider at concentration and hour duration (two sliders)
9. Pankreatit: IF (NPU19652) OR (NPU19653) OR (DNK05451) ≥3 x upper normal limit + (NPU19748) > 100 mg/l 
then patient would have pancreatitis.
(NPU19652) normal limit = 120 U/l 
(NPU19653) normal limit = 36 U/I
(DNK05451) normal limit = 190 U/I
(NPU19748) normal limit = 100 mg/L
